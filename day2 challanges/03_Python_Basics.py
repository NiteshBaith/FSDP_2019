# Modular Programming and Modules

"""
Modules are files containing Python statements and definitions, 
like function and class definitions.

Kinds of Modules

There are different kind of modules:

    1. Those written in Python
        They have the suffix: .py
    2. Dynamically linked C modules
        Suffixes are: .dll, .pyd, .so, .sl, ...
    3. C-Modules linked with the Interpreter:
       
        
import numpy
numpy.__file__
     
A package is basically a directory with Python files and a file with the name __init__.py.
Packages are a way of structuring Python’s module namespace by using "dotted module names". 
A.B stands for a submodule named B in a package named A. 


A Module contains a lot of functions
